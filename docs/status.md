# Project Status

**Last updated**: 2026-09-10

## What This Repo Is

Wowee is a native C++ World of Warcraft client experiment focused on connecting to real emulator servers (online/multiplayer) with a custom renderer and asset pipeline.

## Current Code State

Implemented (working in normal use):

- Auth flow: SRP6a auth + realm list + world connect with header encryption
- Rendering: terrain, WMO/M2, water/magma/slime (FBM noise shaders), sky system, particles, shadow mapping, minimap/world map, loading video playback
- Instances: WDT parser, WMO-only dungeon maps, area trigger portals with glow/spin effects, zone transitions
- Character system: creation (including nonbinary gender), selection, 3D preview with equipment, character screen, per-instance NPC hair/skin textures
- Core gameplay: movement (with ACK responses), targeting (hostility-filtered tab-cycle), combat, action bar, inventory/equipment, chat (tabs/channels, emotes, item links)
- Quests: quest markers (! and ?) on NPCs/minimap, quest log with detail queries/retry, objective tracking, accept/complete flow, turn-in, quest item progress
- Trainers: spell trainer UI, buy spells, known/available/unavailable states
- Vendors, loot (including chest/gameobject loot), gossip dialogs (including buyback for most recently sold item)
- Bank: full bank support for all expansions, bag slots, drag-drop, right-click deposit
- Auction house: search with filters, pagination, sell picker, bid/buyout, tooltips
- Mail: item attachment support for sending
- Spellbook with specialty/general/profession/mount/companion tabs, drag-drop to action bar, spell icons, item use
- Talent tree UI with proper visuals and functionality
- Pet tracking (SMSG_PET_SPELLS), dismiss pet button
- Party: group invites, party list, out-of-range member health (SMSG_PARTY_MEMBER_STATS)
- Nameplates: NPC subtitles, guild names, elite/boss/rare borders, quest/raid indicators, cast bars, debuff dots
- Floating combat text: world-space damage/heal numbers above entities with 3D projection
- Target/focus frames: guild name, creature type, rank badges, combo points, cast bars
- Map exploration: subzone-level fog-of-war reveal
- Warden anti-cheat: full module execution via Unicorn Engine x86 emulation; module caching
- Audio: ambient, movement, combat, spell, and UI sound systems; NPC voice lines for all playable races (greeting/farewell/vendor/pissed/aggro/flee)
- Bag UI: independent bag windows (any bag closable independently), open-bag indicator on bag bar, server-synced bag sort, off-screen position reset, optional collapse-empty mode in aggregate view
- DBC auto-detection: CharSections.dbc field layout auto-detected at runtime (handles stock WotLK vs HD-textured clients)
- Multi-expansion: Classic/Vanilla, TBC, WotLK, and Turtle WoW (1.18) protocol and asset variants
- CI: GitHub Actions for Linux (x86-64, ARM64), Windows (MSYS2 x86-64 + ARM64), macOS (ARM64); container builds via Podman

Recent refactors (PRs #59-63, April 2026):

- Chat system decomposed into 15+ modules under `src/ui/chat/` with 11 command modules, GM command support, macro evaluator, and tab completion
- World map decomposed into 16 modules under `src/rendering/world_map/` with overlay layer system, view state machine, and ZMP-based hover detection
- TransportManager decomposed: spline math extracted to `src/math/`, path data to TransportPathRepository, 7 duplicated spline parsers consolidated into `spline_packet.cpp`
- Spell visual effects system with bone-tracked ribbons and particles
- Entity movement improvements: multi-segment path interpolation, terrain height clamping, walk/run animation fix
- 31 unit-test suites (up from 8), covering chat, world map, spline math, transport, and animation systems
- Code quality fix pass: 7 issues resolved across hover detection, null safety, buffer bounds, and coordinate validation

Recent fixes (July 2026):

- Login pipeline hardened: login-critical opcodes have hardcoded fallback when opcode table lookup fails; OpcodeTable::loadFromJson() is now safe against failed reloads (issue #87)
- Integrity hash is build-aware: Classic-era DLLs only required for builds <=6005 or Turtle; TBC/WotLK hash only the .exe
- Strafing reworked: torso-twist via SpineLow bone rotation instead of dedicated strafe animations
- Camera smoothing snaps 1:1 during active drag/keyboard turn to reduce input lag
- Mount strafing uses MOUNT_RUN_LEFT/RIGHT when available

Recent work (August 2026):

- FrameXML interface transition: the original interface owns the chat window, and this client's own was removed along with the tab manager and completer that served it. The command registry, macro evaluation, and chat bubbles stay - FrameXML's edit box routes unknown slash commands into `runClientChatCommand`. See the Unreleased section of `CHANGELOG.md`
- Warnings are errors: `WOWEE_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` (default ON) puts `-Werror` / `/WX` on the `wowee` target. Turn it off for a bisect or an unfamiliar compiler
- AMD FidelityFX SDK backends are off by default (`WOWEE_ENABLE_AMD_FSR2`, `WOWEE_ENABLE_AMD_FSR3_FRAMEGEN`). This client's own FSR 1 and `fsr2_*` compute shaders are in-tree and unaffected
- 89 test suites registered with CTest, up from the 31 noted above
- macOS: SIGPIPE is ignored at startup, so a send to a dropped connection no longer terminates the client; crash backtraces now work there as well as on Linux

Modern rendering, phase 01 (September 2026):

- The four lit fragment shaders were consolidated once, before anything was added to them: the shadow filter, the fog ramp and the parallax march are `assets/shaders/*.glsl` includes now (`shadow_common.glsl`, `fog.glsl`, `parallax.glsl`, gathered by `lit_common.glsl`), and the per-frame uniform block grew once - cascade matrices, height-fog parameters and SH9 ambient slots - rather than once per technique
- Every renderer toggle is a specialization constant rather than a uniform `int` and an `if`. The defaults are what the client did before, so a pipeline built with no `VkSpecializationInfo` is the shader that shipped. `tests/shader_offpath_identity` measures that rather than asserting it: it compiles the archived pre-phase source and the current one, freezes the constants at their defaults, and compares what the two actually compute
- `VkContext::getRenderCaps()` reports a capability tier and a flag per optional feature, and a settings row the GPU cannot honour is greyed with the reason instead of being silently ignored
- Exponential height fog with a sun-coloured in-scatter term, calibrated against each zone's own Light.dbc fog end so the horizon does not move and no zone shifts hue. `fogmodel` and `fogaerial` on the Graphics page; the model is a shader variant, so changing it rebuilds the four lit renderers' pipelines between frames, the way an anti-aliasing change already does
- **Cut to a phase 01b:** cascaded and soft shadows, the shadows-off switch, sun shafts, terrain LOD and normal maps everywhere. `tools/capture_scene`, which `docs/plan-modern-rendering.md` §7.5 describes as already existing, is not in this tree, so there was no way to render a before/after of anything. What is only visible in a picture was not shipped unseen. See `docs/evidence/phase-01/README.md`

In progress / known gaps:

- World map: zone hover detection has edge cases with some zone boundaries; cosmic highlight sizing is approximate
- Transports: M2 transports (trams) working with position-delta riding; WMO transports (ships, zeppelins) working with path following; some edge cases remain
- Quest GO interaction: CMSG_GAMEOBJ_USE + CMSG_LOOT sent correctly, but some AzerothCore/ChromieCraft servers don't grant quest credit for chest-type GOs (server-side limitation)
- Visual edge cases: some M2/WMO rendering gaps (some particle effects)
- Water refraction: enabled by default; srcAccessMask barrier fix (2026-03-18) resolved prior VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST on AMD/Mali GPUs
- Fixed 2026-05-15: classic/turtle update-field tables had multiple wrong indices (`UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_1`=133 colliding with `UNIT_FIELD_MOUNTDISPLAYID`=133; STAT0..4 at 138..142; RESISTANCES at 154; missing NATIVEDISPLAYID). Corrected against vmangos `UpdateFields_1_12_1.h`: BYTES_1=138, STAT0..4=150..154, RESISTANCES=155, added NATIVEDISPLAYID=132.
